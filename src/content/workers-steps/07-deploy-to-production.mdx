Deploying Workers to production involves configuring your Worker for the live environment and setting up basic observability.

- **Production Configuration:** Environment-specific settings
- **Deployment Process:** Using Wrangler to deploy
- **Basic Observability:** Monitoring and logging essentials
</Callout>

## Step 1: Deploy to Production

<StepObjective 
  what="Deploy your Worker to production and make it accessible via a custom domain."
  why="Production deployment makes your Worker available to real users and enables you to serve live traffic."
/>

### Deploy Your Worker

```bash title="Deploy to Production"
# Deploy to production
wrangler deploy

# Deploy with custom name
wrangler deploy --name my-production-worker

# Deploy to specific environment
wrangler deploy --env production
```

### Production Configuration

```json title="wrangler.jsonc - Production Setup"
{
  "name": "my-worker",
  "main": "src/index.ts",
  "compatibility_date": "2024-01-01",
  "routes": [
    { "pattern": "api.example.com/*", "zone_name": "example.com" }
  ],
  "vars": {
    "ENVIRONMENT": "production"
  },
  "observability": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

### Custom Domain Setup

```bash title="Add Custom Domain"
# Add a route to your domain
wrangler route add "api.yourdomain.com/*" my-worker

# Or configure in wrangler.jsonc
```

<Callout type="tip" title="Domain Requirements">
To use a custom domain:

- **Domain on Cloudflare:** Your domain must be managed by Cloudflare
- **DNS Setup:** Ensure proper DNS records are configured
- **SSL Certificate:** Cloudflare provides automatic SSL certificates
</Callout>

## Step 2: Basic Observability

<StepObjective 
  what="Set up basic logging and monitoring to track your Worker's performance and errors."
  why="Observability helps you understand how your Worker is performing and quickly identify issues in production."
/>

### Simple Logging

```typescript title="Basic Logging Setup"
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
    const startTime = Date.now();
    
    try {
      // Log incoming request
      console.log('Request:', {
        url: request.url,
        method: request.method,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      });
      
      // Your request handling logic
      const response = new Response('Hello from production!');
      
      // Log response
      console.log('Response:', {
        status: response.status,
        duration: Date.now() - startTime
      });
      
      return response;
      
    } catch (error: any) {
      // Log errors
      console.error('Error:', {
        message: error.message,
        stack: error.stack,
        url: request.url
      });
      
      return new Response('Internal Server Error', { status: 500 });
    }
  }
};
```

### View Logs and Analytics

```bash title="Monitor Your Worker"
# View real-time logs
wrangler tail

# View logs for specific Worker
wrangler tail my-worker

# Filter logs by status
wrangler tail --status error
```

<Callout type="tip" title="Cloudflare Dashboard">
Access comprehensive analytics in the Cloudflare Dashboard:

- **Workers Analytics:** Request volume, error rates, and performance metrics
- **Real-time Logs:** View logs with filtering and search capabilities  
- **Performance Insights:** CPU usage, memory consumption, and response times
- **Error Tracking:** Detailed error logs and stack traces
</Callout>

## Step 3: Testing Your Deployment

<StepObjective 
  what="Test your production deployment to ensure it's working correctly."
  why="Testing verifies that your Worker is properly deployed and accessible to users."
/>

### Test Your Worker

```bash title="Test Production Deployment"
# Test your Worker URL
curl https://my-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev

# Test with different HTTP methods
curl -X POST https://my-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/api/test

# Test custom domain (if configured)
curl https://api.yourdomain.com/test
```

### Check Deployment Status

```bash title="Verify Deployment"
# List your deployed Workers
wrangler list

# Get Worker details
wrangler status my-worker

# Check recent deployments
wrangler deployments list
```

<Callout type="important" title="Production Checklist">
Before going live:

- ‚úÖ **Worker deployed successfully**
- ‚úÖ **Custom domain configured (if needed)**
- ‚úÖ **Basic logging implemented**
- ‚úÖ **Error handling in place**
- ‚úÖ **Tested all endpoints**
</Callout>

```bash title="üöÄ Production Deployment Complete!"
‚úÖ Worker deployed to production
üìä Basic observability configured  
üåç Ready to serve global traffic!
```

üéâ **Congratulations!** You've completed the entire Cloudflare Workers workshop! You now have the skills to build production-ready serverless applications with database integration, AI capabilities, and enterprise-grade monitoring.
