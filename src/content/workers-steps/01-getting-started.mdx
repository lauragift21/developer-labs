<Callout type="tool" title="Understanding Cloudflare Workers">
Cloudflare Workers is a serverless platform for building, deploying, and scaling applications across Cloudflare's global network with a single command and no infrastructure to manage.

- **Edge Computing:** Code runs at locations closest to users for minimal latency
- **V8 Isolates:** Lightweight, secure runtime environment (not containers)
- **Global Network:** Deploy once, run everywhere across Cloudflare's infrastructure
- **Serverless:** No servers to manage, automatic scaling, pay-per-request
</Callout>

## Step 1: Create Your First Worker

<StepObjective 
  what="A simple Cloudflare Worker that responds to HTTP requests with a custom message."
  why="Workers handle HTTP requests at the edge, providing fast responses to users worldwide with minimal setup."
/>

```bash
# Create a new Worker project with TypeScript
npm create cloudflare@latest -- my-first-worker --type hello-world --ts

# Navigate to your project
cd my-first-worker

# Start development server
npx wrangler dev
```

<CodeBlock title="Expected Output">
‚éî Starting local server...
[wrangler:info] Ready on http://localhost:8787
üåç Your Worker is running locally and ready for testing
üìù Edit src/index.ts to see changes in real-time
</CodeBlock>

<Callout type="note" title="What Just Happened?">
You've created a Cloudflare Worker that includes:
- **HTTP Handler:** Function that processes incoming requests
- **Local Development:** Wrangler dev server for testing
- **Hot Reloading:** Changes reflect immediately during development
</Callout>

<details>
<summary><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></summary>

- **npm not found:** Install Node.js v18+ from nodejs.org
- **Template not found:** Update npm: `npm install -g npm@latest`
- **Permission denied:** Use `sudo npm install -g wrangler` (macOS/Linux)
- **Port 8787 busy:** Stop other services or use `npm run dev -- --port 8788`
- **Build errors:** Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again

</details>

## Step 2: Understanding Your Worker Code

<StepObjective 
  what="Understanding of your Worker's code structure and how it processes HTTP requests."
  why="Understanding the fetch handler is fundamental to building any application with Cloudflare Workers."
/>

Let's examine the default Worker code that was generated:

```typescript
// src/index.ts
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
    return new Response('Hello World!');
  },
};
```

<Callout type="note" title="Worker Structure">
Every Cloudflare Worker exports a default object with handler functions:
- **fetch:** Handles HTTP requests (required for web applications)
- **scheduled:** Handles cron triggers (optional)
- **queue:** Handles queue messages (optional)
- **email:** Handles email events (optional)
</Callout>

### The Fetch Handler Parameters:
- **request:** Contains the incoming HTTP request (URL, headers, method, body)
- **env:** Environment variables and bindings (KV, R2, D1, etc.)
- **ctx:** Context object with `waitUntil()` and `passThroughOnException()`

## Step 3: Test Your Worker

<StepObjective 
  what="A working local development environment where you can test your Worker and see changes in real-time."
  why="Local testing is essential for rapid development and debugging before deploying to production."
/>

### Testing Your Worker:

1. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8787`
2. **You should see:** "Hello World!" displayed in your browser
3. **Try different URLs** like `http://localhost:8787/test` - same response
4. **Check the terminal** for request logs showing method, path, and response time

<Callout type="note" title="What You Should See">
Your terminal will show logs like:
- `GET / 200 OK (2ms)` - successful request
- Hot reloading when you save file changes
- Any console.log() output from your Worker
</Callout>


## Step 4: Deploy to Production

<StepObjective 
  what="Your first Worker deployed to Cloudflare's global network, accessible via a workers.dev subdomain."
  why="Deploying to production lets you see your Worker running at the edge across Cloudflare's global network."
/>

```bash
# Deploy your Worker to production
npx wrangler deploy
```

After deployment, you'll see:
- **Your Worker URL:** `https://my-first-worker.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`
- **Global deployment** across 300+ data centers
- **Instant availability** worldwide

<Callout type="note" title="Production Deployment">
Your Worker is now running on Cloudflare's global network:
- **Global reach:** Available from 300+ locations worldwide
- **Automatic scaling:** Handles traffic spikes without configuration
- **Zero cold starts:** V8 isolates start instantly
- **Built-in security:** DDoS protection and security features included
</Callout>

‚úÖ **Congratulations!** You've created and deployed your first Cloudflare Worker. You're ready to learn HTTP request handling in Step 2!
