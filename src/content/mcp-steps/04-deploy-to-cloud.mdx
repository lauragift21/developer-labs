<Callout type="tool" title="Global Deployment with Workers">
Cloudflare Workers deploy your MCP server to a global network of edge locations, providing low-latency access worldwide.

- **Global Network:** Deploy to 200+ cities worldwide
- **Edge Computing:** Run close to users for minimal latency  
- **Serverless:** Automatic scaling with zero cold starts
- **Built-in Security:** DDoS protection and secure by default
</Callout>

## Step 1: Deploy Your MCP Server

<StepObjective 
  what="A globally deployed MCP server running on Cloudflare's edge network for low-latency access worldwide."
  why="Production deployment makes your MCP server accessible to AI assistants and provides real-world testing capabilities."
/>

### Deployment Process

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="Deploy to Cloudflare Workers">
// Login to Cloudflare (if not already done)
wrangler login

// Deploy to Workers
npm run deploy
</CodeBlock>

### üöÄ Deployment Process:
1. Ensure you're logged into Cloudflare with `wrangler login`
2. Run `npm run deploy` to build and deploy
3. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 30-60 seconds)
4. Copy the deployment URL from the output
5. Note the MCP endpoint: `your-url/mcp`

### Deployment Success
<CodeBlock language="text" title="Deployment Complete!">
‚úÖ Worker deployed successfully<br/>
üåç Available at: https://my-mcp-server.your-account.workers.dev<br/>
üîß MCP endpoint: https://my-mcp-server.your-account.workers.dev/mcp
</CodeBlock>

## Step 2: Test with AI Playground

<StepObjective 
  what="A complete integration test using Cloudflare AI Playground to verify your deployed MCP server works with real AI assistants."
  why="Testing with AI Playground validates that your tools are properly discoverable and functional in a production AI environment."
/>

### üéÆ AI Playground Testing:
1. Visit the [Cloudflare AI Playground](https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com/)
2. Create a new chat session
3. Click the **"Tools"** button in the interface
4. Add your MCP server URL: `https://your-worker.workers.dev/mcp`
5. Click **"Connect"** and verify tools are loaded
6. Test your tools by asking the AI to use them
7. Example: "Generate a random number between 1 and 100"

<Callout type="note" title="What You Should See">
In the AI Playground, you should be able to:
- **Connect Successfully:** Your MCP server loads without errors
- **Tool Discovery:** AI can see and understand your tools
- **Tool Execution:** AI can call your tools and get responses
- **Natural Integration:** Tools work seamlessly in conversation
</Callout>
